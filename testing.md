# Testing
For my testing I enlisted the help of a web developer with almost a decade of experience.

The user testing I did had him blindly open the application and go through the features. I had him share his screen with me and observed him using the app.
It was very helpful because he was checking the application in multiple device views and testing features without me needing to explain them to him.

His feedback:
- The app loads quickly and looks very clean
- On the filter screen I should change the text on the area/zipcode text field to 'Chicago zipcode' instead of 'zipcode' to be more clear
- On the filter screen I can clarify the text under the 'Filter heading' to say 'choose chicago parks' because "a lot of times people see an input right away and go straight to it", so having clarification would helpful
- The notification for removing parks is well done (my snackbar pop-up)
- He recommends that when Favorite Parks are added I should add a hyperlink so that on a press of a park it opens the default map app and displays the parks
- The slider is very clear thanks to the tooltip that appears when sliding
-


My modifications:
- Clarified the zipcode textfield
- Clarified the filter page test
- Added a click handler to each favorite list item to open google maps
